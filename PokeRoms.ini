Notes_about_this_ini: -
Note1 = justusestandardini allows you to turn the dynamic ini system on or off. Has two values (case sensistive)-> True or False
Note2 = The lists (like EggGroups) must be in order from lowest to highest.
Note3 = If you want to provide a name for your game in the ini, just do Name = X. See below examples. Eventually, I will load this name to the program and display it.
