~~~~ATTENTION MAC USERS:~~~~ Does this error look familiar?: ---->File "/Users/homedepot326/Desktop/Secret-Tool-master/build/mainMAC/out00-PYZ.pyz/wx._core", line 12996, in SetSelection wx._core.PyAssertionError: C++ assertion "item >= 0 && item < [m_comboBox numberOfItems]" failed at /BUILD/wxPython-src-3.0.0.0/src/osx/cocoa/combobox.mm(164) in SetSelectedItem(): Inavlid item index. ----> This error happens when you attempt to load a rom that has expanded pokemon with a clean ini. Trust me, I was testing and forced the error to appear. I have recieved this error report at least 14 times and I can tell that many of them are coming from the same people. Please, do not submit the same bug twice, it only serves to agitate me. Now, I am pretty sure that far too many of you are deleting the ini when upgrading versions. DO NOT DELETE THE INI. The ini is there to hold the locations of all of the important places in the rom that my program needs to access. If you delete the ini and replace it with a new one, your hacked roms with expanded pokes WON'T WORK and WILL result in this error. You see, the offsets of the expanded pokemon are stored in the ini. If you delete it, poof, now G3HS has no idea where to get the data from and therefore will error. To explain this error further, it is attempting to load item #0xFFFF or 65,000. You and I both know that there are far less than 65,000 items. Have you ever tried reading errors? You should. Here, look it tells you what went wrong-> This the last line: "Inavlid item index". Now, why is it trying to load item 0xFFFF? Because the base stats table has been moved to a new location and expanded. The old one was filled with FFFFFFFFF to free up space in your rom. So please, make sure you retain your ini. It is very important. ~karatekid552
