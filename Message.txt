Hey guys, I hope you are enjoying this tool. I have been receiving a lot of reports of "list index out of range" in the function "get_move_data". Now, the list that this is referring to is a two byte read from the rom. There is no way that this could fail to have less than two bytes unless it doesn't have any data to read from the rom. This means, that the pointer to the move data was outside of the rom, more specifically 0xFFFFFF. If that doesn't look familiar, it should. That is free space, which was put there upon expanding the number of pokemon and repointing the move table. Now, I think that so many of you are getting this issue because you are forgetting to retain your ini when changing versions. Remember, my editor uses the ini to find things. If it can't find them, there are going to be issues. So, lets say that you expanded pokemon. About 10 offsets in the ini are changed by this. If you lose your ini, there will be issues because these new locations are now gone and the original locations (that it will try to read from) will only have FFs. So, to be clear, never delete your ini. I will tell you if it needs to be changed. This message will stop showing up in 24 hours. Thank you for your time and support. ~karatekid552
