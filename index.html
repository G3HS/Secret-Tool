  <h2>Intro:</h2>
At the time when tools like YAPE and A-map were created, nobody was thinking about advances in hacking technique that would enable the addition of new types, new moves, and even, an increase in the number of Pokémon. However, those times are gone. Now, we have several tutorials on adding new types and moves, a solid research foundation for new Pokémon, as well as a lot more advances that have rendered tools useless, like expanded OWs. In addition to this, the support for operating systems other than Windows is little to none. Being a Linux user, this got me thinking that we needed a new set of tools for the future.
</p>
<p>
Shinyquagsire has already begun taking care of scripting and mapping with Script Editor Advance (SEA) and Map Editor of Happiness (MEH), both written in Java. My forte is Python, which is also cross-platform. So, in December 2013, I began creating a cross platform hacking suite. The first tab is a Pokémon data editor, designed for the future. It can support new types, new moves, new Pokémon and so much more. Eventually, it will have many more tabs and pop-out windows to edit all sorts of things. So, let's begin.
